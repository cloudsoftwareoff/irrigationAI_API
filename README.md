# Irrigation AI System
This is a web application that uses a machine learning model to predict whether an irrigation pump should be turned on or off 
#Introduction
This project aims to predict the crop yield of a farm based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall. The prediction is made using a machine learning model trained on a dataset of historical crop yields and environmental data
